I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at University of Southern California, starting in 2019. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ram Nevatia. My research interest lies in the area of multimodal perception with vision and language, including compositional zero-shot learning, zero-shot detection and large scale vision-language transformers.

Prior to USC, I was a Master student at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I worked with Prof. David Fouhey and Prof. Jia Deng. I received my Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University in 2017. During my undergrad time, I worked with Prof. Shi-Min Hu.

I spent two wonderful summers in 2021/2022 interning at Amazon Alexa AI, where I worked with Rakesh Chada and [Yue (Rex) Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fONV3IgAAAAJ&hl=en).
